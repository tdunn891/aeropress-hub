            <p>The World AeroPress Championship is a global coffee-making competition, designed to find the world's best
               cup
               of AeroPress coffee.
            </p>
            <p>Each season is comprised of a series regional and national competitions, run by independent hosts across
               60
               countries, which culminates with the World AeroPress Championship final.
            </p>
            <p>The competition itself is a multi-round elimination tournament. In each round, three competitors will
               face
               off
               against each other, simultaneously brewing a single cup of coffee using the AeroPress brewer. Competitors
               have 8 minutes in which to prepare, brew, and present their coffee to a panel of three judges.
